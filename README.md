# Mines Of Mystery

This plugin acts as the main project for my bachelor thesis at HS Anhalt University.
The goal of this project is to create a dungeon-crawler game to demonstrate the capabilities of Minecraft.
The game is designed to be played in multiplayer mode, where players can explore dungeons, fight monsters, and collect
loot.
